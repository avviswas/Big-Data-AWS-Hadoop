1. Mapper will map all pair to key value pairs using the co-occuring words
2. Remove all special character and remove stop list words for better processing
3. Reduce all the words into a tree map
4. From the above step we will get the frequency of co-occurence of the pairs of the words
5. These pairs will be passed to the reducer
6. Now, the reducer will count the aggregation of all the occurences of the pairs seperately.
7. NOw we have the pairs, these pairs will have teir final frequencies
8. Sort the pairs according to their frequencies
9. Execute and see the output.
